## How to use

First, you should clone the repo and install the dependencies.

```bash
$ git clone git@github.com:crli/webpack-react-boilerplate.git <yourAppName>
$ cd <yourAppName>
$ npm install
```

Then, launch the boilerplate app.

```bash
$ npm start
```

You should see a new browser tap opening and a title of "欢迎 你好 hello" in http://127.0.0.1:8080.

From there, you start to develop your own code in the `app` directory. When you finish coding, use `npm run build` to build the static files.
